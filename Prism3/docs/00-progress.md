## Current status (2026-06-20)

**The color AND dimension axes are built, proven against a real brand, and
proven white-label.** From a ~7-input schema the engine generates gamut-aware
OKLCH ramps, places steps by contrast role, generates four contrast-verified
appearance modes, generates the space + radius scales from a primitive grid, and
emits consumable DTCG. It validates all of this against New Balance, and runs a
*second, synthetic* brand (`aurora`) end-to-end — synthesising status palettes,
carving a dedicated danger red the brand never specified, and applying a distinct
form factor (soft corners + compact density). Status, space, and radius
generation are all brand-input-driven, not NB-specific.

Headline numbers (regenerate with the commands below):

| Check | NB | Aurora (white-label) |
|---|---|---|
| Aggregate ΔE00 vs real NB (color) | **1.95** | n/a |
| Tonal-band contrast contracts | **11/11** | (same engine) |
| Cross-mode contrast contracts | **28/28** | **28/28** |
| **Dimension axis (space + radius) vs real NB, exact** | **15/15** | n/a |
| DTCG semantic aliases resolve (color + dim) | **59/59** | **59/59** |
| Color primitives / dim grid emitted | 82 / 37 | 102 / 36 |
| Form factor | comfortable / radius 1 (sharp) | compact / radius 2 (soft) |
| Emit profile | `nbds.*` / rgb | `prism.*` / hex |

Work lives on branch `claude/prism3-token-architecture-leipq2` and is merged to
`main` for review.

### How to run

```bash
# Node ≥ 20. No npm install — color math is self-contained.
npx tsx Prism3/engine/nb-regression.ts   # regression vs real NB
npx tsx Prism3/engine/emit-dtcg.ts       # emit DTCG + modes, validate
```

## Decisions log (why things are the way they are)

- **Build a real prototype, validate against NB.** The thesis ("a brand is a
  small input set the engine expands") is only credible if the engine can
  reproduce an existing hand-built brand. NB is the regression target.
- **TypeScript / Node, dependency-free.** Color math is owned in `color.ts` so
  the engine runs without a network install and the math is auditable. Run via
  `tsx`/`ts-node`; no build step.
- **Keep our intent grammar** (tonal bands, contrast roles) rather than copying
  a vendor's ramp shape. The engine generates from intent, not from NB's hexes.
- **OKLCH generation with exact-anchor preservation.** The brand value is a
  *pinned* step, never shifted (verified: NB `red.550` reproduced at ΔE00 0.05).
- **Chroma arc, not a flat plateau.** First cut held chroma constant and the
  light tints blew out (green.050 ΔE00 20); the regression falsified it. A
  chroma arc that tapers toward both ends dropped green's mean 6.23 → 1.88.
- **Contrast-role-targeted step placement (gap 1).** Steps are *placed* at the
  luminance their role needs, not on an even-L curve. The Mid-Tone 500 sits at
  the dual-side AA pivot (Y≈0.18, clears 4.5:1 on white *and* black). Took the
  contrast contracts to 11/11 and, because NB is Univers-derived, also tightened
  the perceptual fit (aggregate ΔE00 2.14 → 1.95).
- **Modes are derived, not hand-mapped.** Primitives are shared across modes;
  each semantic role re-resolves to a primitive step by contrast target against
  the mode's surface. The brand anchor is preserved where it can be (light
  `action.primary` = `red.550`) and auto-adjusted where it can't (dark → `red.450`).
- **Status palettes are engine-supplied; danger is carved (white-label).** A
  brand supplies primary + neutral; the engine synthesises success/warning from
  canonical hues. If the primary is in red territory the brand red *is* the
  danger red (NB); otherwise the engine carves a dedicated danger red the brand
  never specified (aurora). Proven by running a second, non-red brand end-to-end.
  *Rationale:* status-from-anchors only worked because NB happened to supply
  them; a real white-label brand won't, and `danger == primary` for a red brand
  is a coincidence that breaks for everyone else (review finding).
- **Two emit profiles, one engine.** `nbds.color`/rgb for the NB regression
  (byte-comparable to real NB) and `prism.color`/hex for product output
  (DTCG-standard, Style-Dictionary-safe). Resolves the namespace + value-format
  review notes without losing NB comparability.
- **NB's per-step hue kinks are NOT reproduced, by design.** Per-step hue drift
  would be a brand input the schema deliberately resists ("resist the seventh").
  The `amber.600`/`red.300` outliers characterise NB's hand-authoring; they are
  not an engine gap (review finding — reframed from an earlier "opt-in feature").
- **Dimension axis mirrors the color architecture: primitives + semantic
  aliases.** A primitive `dimension` grid (4px: 0,1,2,4,6,8,…,128) with `space`
  and `radius` semantic tokens aliasing into it — the same shape as color ramps
  + semantic roles. Two levers carry all variance: `density` (one enum) shifts
  the space mapping along the grid; `radius.scale` (one scalar) scales the corner
  ramp from sharp to soft. Reproduces NB's space + radius **exactly** (15/15)
  from `baseUnit=4` / `comfortable` / `scale=1`, and aurora runs a *different*
  form factor (compact / scale 2) through the same code. These are integer px, so
  the bar is exact equality, not perceptual ΔE.

## Open items / next steps (roughly prioritized)

Reordered per external review: prove breadth (a second brand through the full
stack) before pipeline plumbing — it tests the white-label thesis harder.

1. **Finish "beyond color": typography + motion.** Space + radius are DONE (the
   dimension axis above). Still to do: the modular type scale / weight ladder /
   fluid triplets from `typography`, and the motion duration/easing ramp from
   `motionPersonality`. Typography is the bigger lever (the font-swap white-label
   claim) and the larger remaining gap.
2. **Prove downstream consumption.** Feed `out/*.tokens.json` through Style
   Dictionary and/or the Figma MCP — confirm a real tool ingests it and the four
   modes map to Figma variable modes. Turns "generation" into "pipeline".
3. **Round-trip the raw-figma format.** Emit the second parallel format
   (`raw-figma/`) the repo keeps, preserving `variableId` linkage (root `CLAUDE.md`).
4. **Figma binding constraints.** Verify variable/mode constraints via the Figma
   MCP (still outstanding from the architecture review).
5. **Tune status-hue defaults against a reference set** (Tailwind/Radix/Material/
   USWDS + NB's measured green/amber). Current canonical hues (success 145,
   warning 75, danger 27) are plausible but not evidence-derived; functionally
   safe (placed by luminance) but worth grounding. Overrides already wired via
   `BrandInput.status` / schema `statusColors`.

## Constraints to respect (from root CLAUDE.md)

- The base repo is design-tokens-only (JSON, no build). The `Prism3/engine/`
  tool is a new, self-contained addition — don't impose a build system on the
  token data.
- When editing existing brand tokens, change **both** the `raw-figma/` and
  `tokens/` (DTCG) copies and keep `variableId` linkage intact. (The engine
  currently emits a fresh DTCG tree under `engine/out/`; it does not yet write
  back into the brand token dirs.)
- Preserve namespaces (`nbds.*` for NB, `nbds.pds.*` for Prism2). Validate by
  JSON parse + every `{…}` alias resolving.
